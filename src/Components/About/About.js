                Ebhoom has the vision and the technology to transform our planet
                into a beautiful and clean one. Solid Waste Management and water
                pollution has always been a universal issue and Ebhoom is here
                to bring you Solutions. Our scope includes Water recycling
                solutions, solid waste management, Ecology restoration and Urban
                Gardening. One of our goals is to eradicate water scarcity. We
                have developed our own technology that can be used for
                desalination, which opens the path to abundant water for the
                entirety of earth. The three R principle of Reduce, Reuse and
                Recycle will be our guideline for Solid waste management. Our
                water disposal technologies will treat the waste/effluent water
                making it suitable for disposal and prevent the contamination of
                ground, ground water and other water resources. The
                reforestation is our eco-project, to give earth back the woods
                we took from her. <br />
                Our mission is to purify the earth, and our vision is that we
                live a fresh life in it.
